MyAdventure: Choose your Own Oregon Trail Story allows you relive one of the greatest adventures in American history. It was a long, difficult journey that often resulted in failure and death.  But for those who succeeded, it led to a new and better life in Oregon. If for some reason you don't survive your wagon burns, you run out of provisions, or you die of cholera don't give up!  

Unlike the real-life pioneers of 1848, you can try again and again until you succeed and get a winning score (of 3). On the screen you'll see choices that you can click to perform different functions vital to the success of your journey. See the score as you respond to each question. Good Luck!
